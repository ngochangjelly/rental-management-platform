# Netlify Deployment Configuration ✅

## 🚀 Netlify Configuration Updated

Your Netlify deployment is now configured to work with Webpack:

### Changes Made:

1. **✅ Updated `netlify.toml`**:
   - Changed publish directory from `public` → `dist`
   - Build command remains `npm run build` (now runs Webpack)
   - Added route redirects for all pages

2. **✅ Route Configuration**:
   ```
   /dashboard → /dashboard.html
   /investor-management → /investor-management.html  
   /login → /login.html
   /* → /index.html (fallback)
   ```

3. **✅ Production Build Tested**:
   - Files are minified and optimized
   - Content hashes work: `dashboard.fb78f1ce.js`
   - All static assets copied correctly

## 📁 Deployment Structure

**Netlify will now serve from:**
```
dist/
├── dashboard.html          # With auto-injected bundled JS
├── investor-management.html # With auto-injected bundled JS  
├── login.html             # With auto-injected bundled JS
├── index.html             # Landing/redirect page
├── js/
│   ├── dashboard.[hash].js        # Bundled & minified
│   ├── investor-management.[hash].js # Bundled & minified
│   └── login.[hash].js           # Bundled & minified
├── manifest.json          # PWA manifest
├── sw.js                 # Service worker
├── _redirects            # API redirects
└── browserconfig.xml     # Browser config
```

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Build Process**: `npm run build` → Webpack creates optimized bundles
2. **Netlify Deploys**: From `dist/` folder (not `public/`)
3. **Cache Busting**: Automatic via content-based hashing
4. **Route Handling**: Clean URLs work via Netlify redirects

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **No more manual versioning needed** - Webpack handles it automatically
- **Faster loading** - Minified and optimized bundles
- **Better caching** - Files only change hash when content changes
- **Clean URLs** - `/dashboard`, `/login`, `/investor-management` all work

## 🧪 Testing

Your next Netlify deployment will:
✅ Build using Webpack (`npm run build`)  
✅ Serve optimized files from `dist/`  
✅ Handle all routes correctly  
✅ Cache bust automatically  

**Your Netlify deployment is ready for the Webpack setup!** 🎉
